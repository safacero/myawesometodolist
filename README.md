# My Awesome ToDo List :D

This project is just a simple todo list app created with React and Vite. This is intended to show the usage of Vitest within Visual Studio.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
1. Open the .sln file in Visual Studio
1. Open `vitest.config.js` and change the path there for the path of your own Visual Studio installation 
1. Build the project so `npm install` runs and the dependencies are installed
1. Open the Test Explorer to see the tests and start playing! :)
